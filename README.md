# Title: Detecting Fake News Using Machine Learning

Description:
The fake news detection project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of identifying and classifying fake news articles from legitimate ones. The project leverages various natural language processing (NLP) techniques, feature engineering, and supervised learning algorithms to train a model on a labeled dataset of news articles. The model is designed to analyze textual content, linguistic patterns, and metadata features to identify potential indicators of misinformation or deceptive information. Through a combination of text classification, sentiment analysis, and fact-checking techniques, the model can assess the credibility and reliability of news articles. The project involves preprocessing and cleaning the data, feature extraction, model training, and performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The ultimate goal is to create a robust and scalable fake news detection system that can help individuals, news organizations, and social media platforms combat the spread of false information and promote media literacy.
